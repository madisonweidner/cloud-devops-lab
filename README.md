# Cloud & DevOps Lab (Personal Learning)
Welcome to my lab for **Cloud Engineering** and **DevOps**.  
This repository tracks my hands-on practice with infrastructure, automation, and cloud services.

## 🚀 Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document my learning journey in DevOps and Cloud Engineering.
- Practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like **Terraform**.
- Experiment with cloud providers such as **Microsoft Azure** and eventually **AWS**.
- Continue learning best practices for infrastructure deployment

## 🗂️ Planned Repository Structure
_(This section will evolve as the repo grows.)_

## 🛠️ Current Focus: Azure Terraform Lab
Currently, this repo contains my first Terraform configuration for Azure that deploys:
- A Resource Group
- A Virtual Network and Subnet
- A Network Security Group
- A Linux Virtual Machine with SSH Key authentication
- Basic network configurations

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Avoid hard coding, and opt for variables going forward
- Create reusuable modules 
- Implement solutions as simply as possible 
- Build and manage Azure infrastructure using Terraform
